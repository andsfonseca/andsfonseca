## Hi there, I'm Anderson Silva ğŸ‘‹

<hr>

### Github asked to expose me, so...

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my masters my masters in informatics
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a little of everything
- ğŸ‘¯ I try to collaborate in whatever I can
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m always looking for help
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about game or web development and I'll not be responsible for what comes next
- âš¡ Fun fact: one plus one is two. This is very easy.
